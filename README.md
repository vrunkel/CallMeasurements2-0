Example app showing a way to automatically extract measurements of bat calls from realtime recordings

This is a small example showing how to measure bat calls and extract these measurements for species didentification. It does not need many ressources or computing power and relies on established methods.

The applications comes as is and is relying on 500 kHz samplerate for best operation. For other samplerates the results and data display may be not perfect.

Feel free to use the code in scientific projects. For any commercial use you best contact me to work out details of licensing.
